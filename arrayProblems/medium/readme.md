# Array Problems medium

1. ## Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target. 1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO. 2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}. Note: You are not allowed to use the same element twice. Example: If the target is equal to 6 and num[1] = 3, then nums[1] + nums[1] = target is not a solution.

2. ## Problem Statement: Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Write a program to in-place sort the array without using inbuilt sort functions. ( Expected: Single pass-O(N) and constant space)

3. ## Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array. You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.

4. ## Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and returns its sum .

5. ## Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and returns its sum and prints the subarray.

6. ## Problem Statement: You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on an ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

7. ## Problem Statement: There’s an array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ with an equal number of positive and negative elements. Without altering the relative order of positive and negative elements, you must return an array of alternately positive and negative values. Note: Start the array with positive elements.

8. ## Problem Statement: Given an array Arr[] of integers, rearrange the numbers of the given array into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers. If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange to the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

9. ## Problem Statement: Given an array, print all the elements which are leaders. A Leader is an element that is greater than all of the elements on its right side in the array.

10. ## Problem Statement: You are given an array of ‘N’ integers. You need to find the length of the longest sequence which contains the consecutive elements.

11. ## Problem Statement: Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 and then return the matrix.

12. ## Problem Statement: Given a matrix, your task is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

13. ## Problem Statement: Given a Matrix, print the given matrix in spiral order.

14. ## Problem Statement: Given an array of integers and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals k. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
