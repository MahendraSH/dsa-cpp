1. ## Problem Statement: Given an array, we have to find the largest element in the array.

2. ## Problem Statement: Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

3. ## Problem Statement: Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.

4. ## Problem Statement: Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

5. ## Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, left rotate the array by one place.
6. ## Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, rotating array of elements by k elements either left or right.

7. ## Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

8. ## Problem Statement: Given an array, and an element num the task is to find if num is present in the given array or not. If present print the index of the element or print -1.

9. ## Problem Statement: Given two sorted arrays, arr1, and arr2 of size n and m. Find the union of two sorted arrays.

10. ## Problem Statement: Given an integer N and an array of size N-1 containing N-1 numbers between 1 to N. Find the number(between 1 to N), that is not present in the given array.

11. ## Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

12. ## Problem Statement: Given a non-empty array of integers arr, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

13. ## Problem Statement: Given an array and a sum k, we need to print the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.

14. ## Problem Statement: Given an array and a sum k, we need to print the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.
