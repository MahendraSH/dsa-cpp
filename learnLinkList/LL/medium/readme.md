4. ## Problem Statement: Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false. [codingninjas](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/cycle-detection-in-a-singly-linked-list_628974) [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
