1. ## Problem statement: You are given a sorted array of integers and a target, your task is to search for the target in the given array. Assume the given array does not contain any duplicate numbers.

2. ## Problem Statement: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.

3. ## Problem Statement: Given a sorted array of N integers and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.

4. ## Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array arr of distinct values and a target value x. You need to search for the index of the target value in the array.If the value is present in the array, then return its index. Otherwise, determine the index where it would be inserted in the array while maintaining the sorted order.

5. ## Problem Statement: Youâ€™re given an unsorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x

6. ## Given a sorted array of N integers, write a program to find the index of the last occurrence of the target key. If the target is not found then return -1.

7. ## Problem Statement: You are given a sorted array containing N integers and a number X, you have to find the occurrences of X in the given array.

<!-- the rotated sorted arrray is not working  -->

8. ## Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

9. ## Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicate values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Return True if k is present and otherwise, return False.
