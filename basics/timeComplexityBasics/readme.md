# timeComplexity basics

# what is timeComplextiy

- Independent of the machine and its configuration, on which the algorithm is running on.
- Shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs.
- Can distinguish two algorithms clearly without ambiguity.

## types

Big O - warst case

omega Ω - best case

theta θ - Average case
```cpp
count = 0
for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
	count++;
//  this code takes O(n2)
```

# Space complexity 

```cpp
int a[]= new int [n];
//  O(n)
```
